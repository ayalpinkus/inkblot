 * End template for Webcomic Infinite page template.
 * 
 * This template is included after the last item in the scroll. You can put
 * anything you like here, but you need to at least have a hidden input named
 * `inkblot-webcomic-infinite-stop` with a value of `1` in this template. This
 * lets the javascript handling the infinite scroll know that we've reached the
 * end and we can stop trying to load more webcomics.
